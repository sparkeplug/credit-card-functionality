# credit-card-functionality

A quick sample of credit card functionality using HTML,CSS &amp; JS [ NO FRAMEWORKS ]

# STEPS TO RUN :

    1. Clone the Repo
    2. Use a lite server to run the index.html to serve the file (e.g. VS CODE - live server)

# CODE walkthrough :

    1. Fetching the data from the api and have stroed locally using 'fetch' calls.
    2. Used local storage to store and retrieve card data.
    3. Using stored data, dynamically rendering the SAVED CARDS functionality.
    4. Completed the UI templates with minor css issues. [ Ignored with respect to less time ].
    5. Validations are still pending, but have tried to use REGEX patterns.
    6. Have used BEM methodology in CSS for clarity.

NOTE: With the available time and with no frmework restrictions and with no reference material allowed, This require more time to complete the functionality.
